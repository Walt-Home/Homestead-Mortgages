# Environments

An environment is a task, the tools a model may use, and a grader the model
never sees. `packages/environments` holds them. The first, `refi-review`
1.0.0, grades a model on the daily refinance review, using synthetic loans
only and with the engine itself as the grader.

## refi-review

**The task.** One loan as the review sees it (the engine's row, after the
tape is read), the review date, today's quoted 30-year rate (or none), the
loan's offer history and the tape's exceptions. The system prompt is the
rulebook (`src/refi/rulebook.ts`): `reviewLoan` written out step by step, in
the engine's order, with every rounding where the engine makes it.

**The tools.** Primitives only: `level_payment`, `balance_after`, `per_diem`,
`present_value`, `date_add`, `days_between`, `end_of_month`,
`whole_months_between`, and `calculate` (exact decimal arithmetic, no
`eval`). The money tools are the engine's own exported primitives. No tool
takes a loan or returns a verdict. The answer goes in through
`submit_review`; a malformed submission comes back as an error and can be
resubmitted.

**The grader.** `reviewLoan` on the task's inputs, run at grading time. It
checks:

- the verdict;
- the reasons, as a set of the rulebook's codes;
- for a candidate, all 13 disclosure figures, to the cent;
- for a watched loan, the watch rate.

A pass means every field is right. The score is the share of fields right;
it is recorded next to the pass and never replaces it.

**Splits.**

- `train`: any seed.
- `heldout`: seed 1, 200 tasks. Every reported score is measured on this
  suite, and it never appears in a prompt, a few-shot example or a training
  run.
- `spec`: the servicing spec's own cases (worked example 1, the
  Massachusetts rule, cooldown, cap, watching, no quote, stale value,
  exclusions).

Each task is drawn from its own seeded stream keyed by its id, so any task
can be rebuilt from its split, seed and index alone.

**Runs.** Each episode is one line appended to a JSONL file and never
rewritten. A line records:

- the task's coordinates and rendered text;
- the environment version, plus hashes of the rulebook and the tools;
- the engine's rule-set and port versions;
- the policy;
- the whole transcript, the answer, every graded field, and the token usage
  (uncached, cache read, cache write, output).

Runs land in `packages/environments/runs/`, which git ignores.

## Commands

```bash
npm run build -w @hm/environments
npm run env:refi -w @hm/environments -- --policy reference
npm run env:refi -w @hm/environments -- --policy anthropic --model claude-opus-5-5 --effort high --n 20
npm run env:refi -w @hm/environments -- --policy vertex --split train --n 5
```

The default is the reference policy on the held-out suite. A model run
spends real money, and it is never the default.

There are two model policies, and neither falls back to another model:

- **`anthropic`** calls Claude over the Messages API. It needs an Anthropic
  key in the environment.
- **`vertex`** calls an open model that Vertex AI serves as a managed API on
  our own project. The default is `deepseek-ai/deepseek-v4.1-flash-maas`, at
  $0.30 / $1.20 per million input / output tokens ($0.03 cached), billed to
  the Google Cloud project.
  - It authorizes with `gcloud auth print-access-token` and names
    `homestead-mortgages` in the URL and in `x-goog-user-project`, because
    gcloud's default project on the Mac is Walt's.
  - Google's docs say DeepSeek's function calling is worse with a system
    prompt, so this policy puts the rulebook at the top of the first user
    message instead.
  - Thinking is on (`--thinking off` turns it off), and the reasoning goes
    back with its assistant turn.
  - Every request streams. The endpoint takes 2 to 70 seconds a turn, and
    some turns run past five minutes. Unstreamed, that is where Node's fetch
    gives up waiting for headers, which ended four of the first five smoke
    episodes. A dropped connection is retried whole.

## What keeps it honest

- **The reference policy** (`src/refi/reference.ts`) follows the rulebook
  through the tools alone, reading only the rendered task. The tests hold
  it to 100 % on the held-out suite, a 300-task training suite and the spec
  cases. A task it fails is a defect in the environment, not a hard
  question.
- **The grader matches the spec.** Every spec case gets the verdict the
  spec states, worked example 1 matches to the cent, and an answer one cent
  off any figure fails on exactly that field.
- **The generator** makes every loan internally consistent: the payment,
  balance and remaining term agree under the engine's own amortization. It
  turns up every verdict at more than 12 % and every reason code in the
  rulebook.

## Not in 1.0.0

- Reading the raw tape line. The task starts after `universeLoanOf`.
- The two gates that read Fannie Mae delivery records. The engine treats
  them as open, so the task does too.
- Cash-out candidates, and the analyst's written rationale.
- A hand read of 50 passing model runs. This is the last item on Phase 1's
  gate, and it needs model runs first.
